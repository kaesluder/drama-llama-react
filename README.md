# Drama Llama

## An experiment in feed reading and natural language processing.

### Project Background and Status

**This is a code bootcamp project in-progress!**

This is my final project for [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/). You can check out the [project prospectus](https://kaesluder.github.io/kae-garden-wiki/Ada_Capstone_Documentation/drama_llama_draft_2022-12-11/) for full details.

This project is _not_ at all usable at this point. Currently it consists of a react GUI (this repo) and a separate [python server](https://github.com/kaesluder/drama-llama-py) that will be integrated into a single desktop app eventually. See the [python server readme](https://github.com/kaesluder/drama-llama-py) for build instructions and stand-alone binaries for Mac M1
